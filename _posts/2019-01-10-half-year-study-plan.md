Below is my study plan for half year  
Inspired by [Coding Interview University][cid]  
I want to switch my position from software/web developer to software engineer. That means computer science knowledge is required for me  
To achieve this goal, I will update my study plan regularly

## Pick One Language for the Interview
I picked Java for my study. Because I like strict programming language, and I think it will be easy to study Data structure or Design Patterns.
