# Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis
Below is what I learned from following lecture  
[Basic Data Structures][lecture] by Neil Rhodes

## Definition
Amortized cost: Given a sequence of n operations, the amortized cost is:  
Cost(n operations) / n

### In case of dynamic array
Regarding PushBack(), still worst case is O(n)  
But amortized cost will be O(1)
